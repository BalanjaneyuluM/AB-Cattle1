                <p>Our journey starts with contented cows, and this sense of well-being permeates every stage of our
                    meticulous processes. When we declare<BR> that contented cows yield superior milk, it's more than
                    just a statement! Did you know that cows thrive in a calm and predictable environment? <BR>A lack of
                    routine can leave them bewildered and, in essence, "stressed out.</p>
                <P>A contented cow is a productive cow, and you can genuinely discern the difference in the milk
                    quality.Yes, it's true! Another key to a cow's <BR>happiness is good health. At Oakridge, our
                    devoted farmers and veterinarians ensure an optimal living environment for our beloved cows,<BR>
                    fostering their well-being and contentment.</P>

                <h1 class="section-title"> OUR <span>RO</span>OTS</h1>
                <p>It all started over 100 years ago with the Adolph Bahler family. Our family was one of many small
                    farms scattered across New England raising <br> not only dairy cows but also growing tobacco and
                    potatoes as cash crops. Through the decades dairy became our passion and while time moved<br> on and
                    other dairy farms closed their doors, we pushed forward. Through that process we learned one thing;
                    quality does not happen by chance; <br>it’s done on purpose. In 2016 we decided to take things to
                    the next level by building our current facility that is 318,000 sq. ft. We built this <br>with three
                    things in mind: first and foremost the comfort of our cows and efficiency & sustainability. The
                    integrity of our farm and milk has been<br> our priority from the beginning.

                <p>Now well into a 5th generation, our goal is to get great tasting milk from our parlor to your home as
                    quickly as possible so you’re drinking <br>fresh quality milk that you can trust. 50 years ago your
                    local milkman would deliver fresh milk to your doorstep. Every family knew<br> the farm it came
                    from. And you knew it was fresh. Thus began, The Modern Milkman, where old fashioned farming and
                    service meets today’s day and age.<br> The Modern Milkman is a weekly subscription-based box service
                    that delivers fresh AB Cattle.INC> (milked less than 24 hours ago) along with <br>local farm fresh
                    eggs, butter, yogurt, cheese, and so many other products right to your doorstep. While a lot of our
                    milk is still being supplied to <br>Guida’s Milk in New Britain, CT our heart is in The Modern
                    Milkman and believe this is the future of dairy, where community and honest dairy come together.</p>
