                <p>At AB Cattle Inc., we boast a rich legacy of prioritizing exceptional animal care, fostering a
                    healthy, secure, <BR>and nurturing environment for our beloved herd. With approximately 2800
                    Holstein cows in our care, <BR>comprising around 2400 actively milking and 400 in a dry state, we
                    have
                    meticulously crafted a haven<BR> for them to leisurely spend their days amidst their companions.</p>
                <br>

                <p>A tour of our facilities will reveal our expansive open-stall barn, spanning 8 acres, designed to
                    allow cows the freedom<BR> to roam at their leisure for activities such as eating, drinking,
                    resting,
                    and socializing. This barn<BR> layout mirrors an outdoor setting, providing the cows with a
                    comfortable
                    retreat shielded from the<BR> elements—offering shade during the summer months and warmth throughout
                    the
                    winter. To further enhance their<BR> well-being, we maintain 2415 open stalls, ensuring ample space
                    and
                    natural ventilation.<BR>Rest assured, at AB Cattle Inc., our commitment to providing our cows with
                    abundant space and a
                    conducive<BR> environment is unwavering.
