                <br><br>
                <p>Let's begin with our largest facility, spanning an impressive 318,000 sq. ft.! This facility serves
                    as the primary residence for <BR>the majority of our cows, featuring an attached milking parlor
                    equipped
                    with a state-of-the-art 72-stall carousel.<BR> Contrary to expectations, our cows genuinely
                    appreciate
                    this barn. Extensive research and over 130 years <BR>of experience have guided us in understanding
                    that
                    cows thrive in a controlled environment.<BR> Being creatures of habit, they find comfort in a
                    predictable routine and appreciate the protection from<BR> the unpredictable weather of New England.

                <p>Scientifically designed, this barn is geared towards fostering content and happy cows, ultimately
                    resulting in the production <BR>of high-quality milk. The facility is equipped with special curtains
                    that can be adjusted to retain heat in the winter and <BR>raised during the summer. Additionally,
                    180
                    adjustable fans across the back of the barn help maintain a comfortable temperature.<BR> Following
                    the
                    model of our open-stall barns, the interior layout mirrors the exterior, allowing cows to freely
                    roam, <BR>huddle, rest, feed, or drink as they please.
                </p>
                <p>The interior amenities include over 82 water troughs providing an unlimited supply of freshwater,
                    ensuring the well-being of our cows.<br> Constant access to fresh feed and bedding further enhances
                    their comfort. To ensure uninterrupted operations,<br> our barn is equipped with a 100% backup
                    generator
                    in case of power loss. Beyond our main barn, AB Cattle Inc.<br> extends this commitment to comfort
                    and
                    well-being to other facilities, such as our dry cow barn and calf barns, all designed to<br> provide
                    the
                    same exceptional level of care.

                        <p>While AB Cattle Inc. proudly upholds 120 years of cherished values and farming traditions,
                            our facility stands as a testament<br> to modern, sustainable practices. In line with our
                            commitment to the environment, our dry cow barn exemplifies<br> this ethos by being adorned
                            with
                            752 solar panels, contributing to a remarkable 25% reduction in annual<br> electrical
                            consumption. </p>
                        <p>When constructing our expansive 8-acre barn, we prioritized energy efficiency. We
                            meticulously installed cutting-edge pumps,<br> fans, and lighting systems to minimize
                            overall
                            energy consumption. Moreover, our dedication to sustainability extends<br> to our manure
                            management practices. As our cows undergo milking, a specialized manure <br>vacuum traverses
                            the
                            area, ensuring cleanliness.</p>
                        <p>The collected manure undergoes a sustainable process. In a designated room, it is deposited
                            into a pit where the liquid component,<br> rich in nutrients, is separated from the dry
                            solid
                            fiber. The liquid waste is then pumped to a covered lagoon atop a hill, mitigating<br> odor
                            and
                            serving as a valuable fertilizer for cropland. Meanwhile, the dry solid fiber,a
                            scentless<br>
                            and nutrient-rich material resembling soft sawdust, is covered and stored for one year.
                            Subsequently,<br> it is employed as bedding, changed daily to maintain optimal comfort for
                            our
                            cows.

                    <h3>DID YOU KNOW?</h3>
                    <p>THE US DAIRY INDUSTRY REDUCED THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF MILK BY 63% DUE TO IMPROVEMENTS IN ANIMAL
                        BREEDING, ANIMAL HEALTH PROGRAMS, <br>COW COMFORT AND OVERALL FARM MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN
                        RECENT
                        DECADES. THE INDUSTRY HAS SET A VOLUNTARY GOAL TO REDUCE THAT BY AN ADDITIONAL<br> 25% BY 2020.
                        COMPARING 1944 AND 2007, PRODUCING A GALLON OF MILK GENERATES 63% LESS CARBON AND USES 90%
                        LESS<br>
                        LAND AND 75% LESS MANURE. IN AMERICA, THE DAIRY INDUSTRY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ONLY 2% OF
                        GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.<br> US MILK PRODUCTION HAS THE LOWEST CARBON FOOTPRINT PER GALLON
                        COMPARED
                        TO ALL OTHER COUNTRIES. </p>
